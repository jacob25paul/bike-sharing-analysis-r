# 🚲 Bike Sharing Demand Analysis in R

**Author**: Jacob Paul  
**Date**: October 2024  
**Status**: Completed academic project for data wrangling and regression modeling in R

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores and models bike rental counts using the UCI **Bike Sharing Dataset**. The goal is to analyze patterns in bike rentals based on weather, temperature, seasonality, and calendar events. 

We perform:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Data transformation and type conversion
- Visualizations with `ggplot2`
- Multiple linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Reproducible reporting using R Markdown

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> **Can we predict bike rental count based on season, weather, temperature, and registered users?**

Additionally, can we:
- Understand how weather and time-based variables influence ridership?
- Build a logistic model to forecast holiday status based on available features?
