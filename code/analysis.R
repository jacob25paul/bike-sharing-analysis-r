#ANS: Yes. There are visibile difference in cnt with respect to weathersit as the median counts are different for each weather situation

#Q13.Build the following multiple linear regression models:
  #a.Perform multiple linear regression with cnt as the response and the predictors are: season, weathersit, atemp, and registered.
model_1 <- lm(cnt ~ season + weathersit + atemp + registered, data = day)
summary(model_1)
  #Write down the math formula with numerical coefficients for predictors  atemp and registered and skip the coefficients for season and  weathersit.
  # cnt = B0 + B1*atemp +B2*registered
  #b.Preform multiple linear regression with cnt as the response and the predictors are: season, workingday, weathersit, atemp, and registered. 
model_2 <- lm(cnt ~ season + workingday + weathersit + atemp + registered, data = day)
summary(model_2)
  #Write down the math formula with numerical coefficients for predictors  atemp and registered and skip the coefficients for season, workingday and weathersit.
  # cnt = B0 + B1*atemp +B2*registered
  #c.Preform multiple linear regression with cnt as the response and the predictors are: season, holiday, workingday, weathersit, atemp, hum, windspeed, and registered. 
model_3 <- lm(cnt ~ season + holiday+ workingday + weathersit + atemp + hum+ windspeed + registered, data = day)

  #d.Which model do you recommend to the management based on adjusted R squared? Justify your answer.
  #Third model is the best in terms of adjusted R-sqaured value(0.9653) because it is closer to one and greater than other two models

#Q15.Build the following logistic models:

  #a.forecast holiday using cnt, season, and registered.

  #d.Which model do you recommend to the management based on McFadden/pseudo R squared to? Justify your answer
#ANS: I would recommend the third model as it has the highest McFadden/pseudo R squared value among the above three models (0.2883)
